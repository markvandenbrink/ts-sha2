# Ionic3 Usage

This provider can be used in any Ionic application :)

## Installation
Make sure, you're inside your ionic-project's folder.

Then run:
```bash
$ ionic generate provider sha2
```

Now, open your newly generated provider and replace it's code with `sha2.ts` `s code which you can find in this folder.

*Thanks a lot to @markvandenbrink for writing this initially in normal Typescript!*
